Defining Custom Constraints
===========================

In some cases, the predefined constraints do not cover all your needs. 
In such scenarios, you can use ``CustomConstraint`` to define your own 
logic on how to constrain your data. There are three main functions that 
you can create:

- ``transform`` which is responsible for the forward pass when using ``transform`` strategy.
  Its main function is to change your data in a way that enforces the constraint.
- ``reverse_transform`` which defines how to reverse the transformation of the ``transform``.
- ``is_valid`` which indicates which rows satisfy the constraint and which ones do not.

Let's look at a demo dataset:

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    from sdv.demo import load_tabular_demo

    employees = load_tabular_demo()
    employees

The dataset defined in :ref:`_single_table_constraints` contains basic details about employees.
We will use this dataset to demonstrate how you can create your own constraint. 


Using the ``CustomConstraint``
------------------------------

We wish to generate synthetic data from the ``employees`` records. If you look at the data 
above, you will notice that the ``salary`` column is a multiple of a *base* value, in
this case the base unit is 500. In other words, the ``salary`` increments by 500. 
We will define ``transform`` and ``reverse_transform`` methods to make sure our 
data satisfy our constraint.

We can achieve our goal by performing transformations in a 2 step process:

- Divide ``salary`` by the base unit (500). This transformation makes it easier for the model 
  to learn the data since it would now learn regular integer values without any explicit constraint on the data.
- Reversing the effect by multiplying ``salary`` back with the base unit. Now that the model has 
  learned regular integer values, we multiply it with the base (500) such that it now conforms to our original data range.


.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    def transform(table_data):
        base = 500.
        table_data['salary'] = table_data['salary'] / base
        return table_data


After defining ``transform`` we create ``reverse_transform`` that reverses the operations made.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    def reverse_transform(table_data):
        base = 500.
        table_data['salary'] = table_data['salary'].round() * base
        return table_data


Then, we pack every thing together in ``CustomConstraint``.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    from sdv.constraints import CustomConstraint

    constraint = CustomConstraint(
        transform=transform, 
        reverse_transform=reverse_transform
    )


Can I apply the same function to multiple columns?
--------------------------------------------------

In the example above we fixed the ``salary`` format, but if we continue observing the data 
we will see that ``annual_bonus`` is also constrained by the same logic. Rather than 
defining two constraints, or editing the code of our functions for each new column that we want 
to constraint, we provide another style of writing functions such that the function should accept 
a column data as input.

The ``transform`` function takes ``column_data`` as input and returns the transformed column.


.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    def transform(column_data):
        base = 500.
        return column_data / base

Similarly we defined ``reverse_transform`` in a way that it operates on the data of a 
single column.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    def reverse_transform(column_data):
        base = 500.
        return column_data.round() * base

Now that we have our functions, we initialize ``CustomConstraint`` and we 
specify which column(s) are the desired ones.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    constraint = CustomConstraint(
        columns=['salary', 'annual_bonus'],
        transform=transform, 
        reverse_transform=reverse_transform
    )


Can I access the rest of the table from my column functions?
------------------------------------------------------------

If we look closely at the data, we notice that ``salary`` and ``annual_bonus`` are only a 
multiple of 500 when the employee is not a "contractor". To take this requirement into 
consideration, we refer to a "fixed" column ``contractor`` in order to know whether we
should apply this constraint or not. The access to ``contractor`` column will allow us
to properly transform and reverse transform the data.

We write our functions to take as input:

-  ``table_data`` which contains all the information.
-  ``column`` which is a an argument to represent the columns of interest.

Now we can construct our functions freely, we write our methods
with said arguments and be able to access ``'contractor'``.

We first write our ``transform`` function as we have done previously:

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    def transform(table_data, column):
        base = 500.
        table_data[column] = table_data[column] / base
        return table_data

When it comes to defining ``reverse_transform``, we need to distinguish between
contractors and non contractors, the operations are as follows:

1. round values to four decimal points for contractors such that the end result will 
   be two decimal points after multiplying the result with 500.
2. round values to zero for employees that are not contractors such that the end
   result will be a multiple of 500.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    def reverse_transform(table_data, column):
        base = 500.
        is_not_contractor = table_data.contractor == 0.
        table_data[column] = table_data[column].round(4)
        table_data[column].loc[is_not_contractor] = table_data[column].loc[is_not_contractor].round()
        table_data[column] *= base
        return table_data

We now stich everything together and pass it to the model.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    from sdv.tabular import GaussianCopula

    constraint = CustomConstraint(
        columns=['salary', 'annual_bonus'],
        transform=transform, 
        reverse_transform=reverse_transform
    )

    gc = GaussianCopula(constraints=[constraint])

    gc.fit(employees)

    sampled = gc.sample(10)


When we view the ``sampled`` data, we should find that all the rows in the sampled 
data have a salary that is a multiple of the base value with the exception
of "contractor" records.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    sampled

This style gives flexibility to access any column in the table while still operating on 
a column basis.


Can I write a ``CustomConstraint`` based on reject sampling?
------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous section, we defined our ``CustomConstraint`` using ``transform`` and 
``reverse_transform`` functions. Sometimes, our constraints are not possible to implement 
using these methods, that is when we rely on the ``reject_sampling`` strategy. 
In ``reject_sampling`` we need to implement an ``is_valid`` function that identifies 
which rows do not follow the said constraint, in our case, which rows are not a multiple 
of the *base* unit.

We can define ``is_valid`` according to the three styles mentioned in the previous section:

1. function with ``table_data`` argument.
2. function with ``column_data`` argument.
3. function with ``table_data`` and ``column`` argument.

``is_valid`` should return a ``pd.Series`` where every valid row corresponds to *True*,
otherwise it should contain *False*. Here is an example of how you would define 
``is_valid`` for each one of the mentioned styles:

.. code-block:: python

    def is_valid(table_data):
        base = 500.
        return table_data['salary'] % base == 0

    def is_valid(column_data):
        base = 500.
        return column_data % base == 0

    def is_valid(table_data, column):
        base = 500.
        is_contractor = table_data.contractor == 1
        valid = table_data[column] % base == 0
        contractor_salary = employees['salary'].loc[is_contractor]
        valid.loc[is_contractor] = contractor_salary == contractor_salary.round(2)
        return valid

Then we construct ``CustomConstraint`` to take ``is_valid`` on its own.

.. code-block:: python

    constraint = CustomConstraint(
        columns=['salary', 'annual_bonus'],
        is_valid=is_valid
    )
